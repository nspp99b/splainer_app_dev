# README

SPLAINER is a cynical micro-blogging application in development by Shahin Motia, a student at Flatiron School.

Create a user account, Splain something to the community, then either "Amen" or call "BS" on user splains!  

Individual splains with more BS calls than Amens will discolor red, and references to users who have more red splains than black will appear red also!

* Ruby version
2.3.3

* System dependencies
Rails 5.1.4
Bootstrap-sass 3.3.7
Bcrypt 3.1.11

* Database creation
rake db:migrate will create development.sqlite3. There's no seed, so go nuts.

* How to run the test suite
ehhhh... forthcoming!  I would ignore the generated tests for now.
